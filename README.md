- Hi, I'm Washington A. Marinho, 26yo and lives in Brazil.
- I’m very curious and interested in learning about everything, but "human relationships, psychology, philosophy, evolutionism and technology" are my passion!
- I’m currently learning to code, starting with python and planing to be a full stack dev. But my ultimate goal is to be a manager, it's been a while that I'm interested in leadership.
- One of my dreams is to create a non-profitable ONG who helps young people who felt lost and depressed to find a path in their lives.
- Even that MTBI test aren't consider precise, I think my results can speak a little more about me, so check out my results at https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/d83a31c13a80d 
- You can find me on Instagram: Tom_as_wel, or e-mail: wam123@hotmail.com
